# Web-Dev-Final
Final project for Web Development 1

4/26
Project ideas:
-Study tool web application - inspired by quizlet
  drag and drop matching
  preload study questions, or should users input study questions?
  show definition, user must type term
-Game - 
  could be inspired by Object Oriented final project - go fish card game
  could be a different kind of card game, but card game relied on Java objects as the cards
  would have to have many different levels of functionality to fully show class material
  maybe a virtual escape room, user would have to do certain actions to "escape" - inspired by that idiot test app
-Blog / Social media site
  easy to add many different functionalities and pages
  could have a game built in, like facebook games

4/28
Began work on project: chose to do the "escape room"-inspired game
  Will have levels where user must perform certain functions in order to move on to the next page
Created login functions and checks
Created a homepage and basic structure for level 1 page

4/29
Began and finished work on Level 1: rainbow drag-and-drop
  Created colored draggable boxes using JQuery UI
  Created gray droppable boxes using JQuery UI
  When colored box is dropped on gray box, JQuery checks if colored in in correct position
Once all colored boxes are in correct position, button for Level 2 pops up
