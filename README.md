# Web-Dev-Final
Final project for Web Development 1

4/26
Project ideas:
-Study tool web application - inspired by quizlet
  drag and drop matching
  preload study questions, or should users input study questions?
  show definition, user must type term
-Game - 
  could be inspired by Object Oriented final project - go fish card game
  could be a different kind of card game, but card game relied on Java objects as the cards
  would have to have many different levels of functionality to fully show class material
  maybe a virtual escape room, user would have to do certain actions to "escape" - inspired by that idiot test app
-Blog / Social media site
  easy to add many different functionalities and pages
  could have a game built in, like facebook games
